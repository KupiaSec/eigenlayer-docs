# SemVerMixin

## Contract Overview

The `SemVerMixin` contract is a reusable abstract contract that provides semantic versioning functionality for other smart contracts in the system. Its primary purpose is to standardize version tracking across the protocol, allowing contracts to maintain and expose their version information in a consistent format that follows the SemVer 2.0.0 specification.

This mixin exists as part of a modular contract architecture where it can be inherited by other contracts that need to expose their version information. The contract uses the gas-efficient `ShortString` data structure from OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library to store version strings with minimal gas costs.

Key design patterns used:
- **Mixin Pattern**: Provides specific functionality that can be combined with other contracts
- **Immutability**: The version is set once at construction time and cannot be changed
- **Inheritance**: Implements the `ISemVerMixin` interface, allowing for consistent interface across the protocol

## Contract Interface

### Public/External Functions
- **`version()`**: A public view function that returns the full semantic version string of the contract (e.g., "v1.2.3"). This function is virtual, meaning inheriting contracts can override its behavior if needed.

### Key State Variables
- **`_VERSION`**: An immutable internal `ShortString` variable that stores the contract's semantic version in a gas-efficient manner. This variable is set during contract construction and cannot be changed afterward.

### Internal Functions
- **`_majorVersion()`**: An internal view function that extracts and returns just the major version portion (e.g., "v1" from "v1.2.3") from the full version string.

## Logic Flow

The contract has a straightforward workflow:

1. **Initialization**:
   - During contract deployment, the constructor accepts a version string parameter (e.g., "v1.2.3").
   - It converts this string to a gas-efficient `ShortString` format and stores it in the immutable `_VERSION` variable.

2. **Version Retrieval**:
   - When external contracts or users call the `version()` function, it converts the stored `ShortString` back to a regular string and returns it.
   - If needed, internal contract logic can retrieve only the major version using the `_majorVersion()` function, which parses the first two characters from the version string (e.g., "v1").

The design ensures that version information is:
- Stored in a gas-efficient manner
- Immutable once set
- Accessible through a standard interface
- Follows the SemVer 2.0.0 specification format

## Dependencies and Interactions

The `SemVerMixin` contract has the following dependencies:

1. **ISemVerMixin Interface**: The contract implements this interface, which standardizes the version-related functionality across the protocol. This ensures that all contracts exposing version information do so in a consistent manner.

2. **OpenZeppelin ShortStringsUpgradeable**: The contract imports and utilizes OpenZeppelin's `ShortStringsUpgradeable` library to efficiently store string data. This optimization is important because storing strings on the blockchain can be expensive in terms of gas costs. The `ShortString` data type is used to store strings of up to 31 bytes directly in a single storage slot, significantly reducing gas costs compared to regular string storage.

The `SemVerMixin` is designed to interact with other contracts through inheritance. Any contract in the system that needs to expose version information would inherit from this mixin, ensuring that version tracking is consistent across the entire protocol. This approach promotes:

- **Standardization**: All contracts handle versioning in the same way
- **Gas Efficiency**: All contracts benefit from the optimized storage approach
- **Maintainability**: Changes to version handling can be made in one place
- **Compatibility**: External systems can reliably interact with the versioning information

The version tracking can be particularly useful for:
- On-chain governance processes that need to verify contract versions
- Protocol upgrades where version compatibility needs to be checked
- Auditing and tracking deployed contract versions in production systems
